Clemens,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,Burda,NA,,0000-0002-7342-2840,"Dr. Burda co-authored a review on the Chemistry and Properties of Nanocrystals of Different Shapes, which is one of the most accessed and cited publications in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He contributed to ~170 publications, H-indexed ~40.

Dr. Clemens Burda is the Director of the Center for Chemical Dynamics and Nanomaterials Research in the Chemistry Department, Case Western Reserve University. Since 2001 he is appointed as a faculty in Physical Chemistry specializing on Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. His interests revolve around optically active or activatable nanomaterials for energy conversion, environmental studies, and health applications. This applies in areas such as photovoltaics, photocatalysis, photobiology and biomedicine, including bioimaging, therapy and tissue targeting for drug delivery. Prof. Burda received his chemistry education in Switzerland and graduated as a doctor of philosophy and science with honors in 1997 from the University of Basel. Dr. Burda is a reviewer for top-ranked nanoscience and chemistry journals, an editorial member for the International Journal of Nanotechnology, and an organizer of the Nanomaterials Conference at the 50th annual SPIE meeting in 2005. He speaks regularly at international conferences. He is also the co-founder of Cleveland Nanocrystal Inc.

Dr. Burda's work is based on these two simple ideas:

    The important issues for our future are mainly Energy, Environment, and Health.
    The important solutions to these challenges will come from using mainly Sun Light as abundant and decentralized energy source.

Therefore, his research is focused on topics outline on the Burda Research Group Web Site:

Ruchika,2017-09-02,2017-09-02,Verma,NA,,0000-0003-4870-128X,"I am passionate about developing machine learning algorithms to solve real world problems at the intersection of precision oncology, digital health and medical big-data. Currently, I am a graduate student in the biomedical engineering department of the Case Western Reserve University. Previously, I completed my masters in Electronics and Electrical Engineering, specializing in signal processing and statistical machine learning, from IIT Guwahati. My work at the crossroads of machine learning, signal and image processing, and computational cancer research has helped me to develop strong analytical, programming and technical communication skills.

My major research contributions are as follows:

1. I am currently investigating the radiomic descriptors from brain tumor habitat to identify standard-of-care treatment resistant patients in Glioblastoma. The identified descriptors will be used to develop morphological biomarkers associated with treatment resistance from histology slides.

2. I recently organized an international competition, MoNuSeg at MICCAI 2018, where 22,000 nuclei boundary annotations on H&E stained images were publicly released. I also released a nuclear segmentation algorithm in 2017 with my IEEE TMI publication.

Dr. Rolock is committed to using intervention research and implementation science to build evidence-informed services and supports for children and families involved in the child welfare system. Dr. Rolock has directed research related to examining the long-term outcomes for children and youth who have exited foster care through adoption or guardianship (post-permanency research). She is currently the Principal Investigator for a multi-year federally funded Understanding Post Adoption and Guardianship Instability project that will examine family experiences and outcomes post legal finalization of adoption or guardianship. Dr. Rolock directed the research for a national (8-site) project that implemented and evaluated interventions aimed at families who have adopted or taken guardianship of children previously in foster care. Understanding the risk and protective factors associated with the long-term stability of children, youth, parents and guardians is of utmost importance to the understanding of child and family well-being.

Douglas,2019-09-13,2019-09-13,Rosenthal,NA,,0000-0001-8126-120X,"In collaboration with the best biomedical researchers, Rosenthal is working on a unique project that explores a new treatment method. The project is called the ""Human Cell Atlas"".
""We hope that by using new methods, such as mathematical modeling, we will be able to understand cancer much better and have more effective therapies,"" says Rosenthal.
Mapping of all cells is considered to be the largest project in medicine, employing 1,000 researchers, and is estimated to take ten years. Rosenthal explains that humans are made of millions of cells and that we know very little about them and their functions.
- If we imagine that the organism is a state, then the cells are inhabitants, but we do not know the differences between them. If we know every cell and its function as an entity, then we also know how to treat it if a disease occurs - says the scientist.
According to him, cancer cells are ""disobedient"", like ""criminals"", who do not obey the rules and violate the rules, but there are significant differences between them.
- You use chemotherapy to kill ""little thieves"" but not ""big mobs"" and affect all cells, not targeting the ones that ""cause"" the problem. We are now trying to understand what these ""mobsters"" are like. The problem with modern medicine is that we look at all cancer cells the same, and there is a big difference between them - Rosenthal points out.
He added that ""current methods, such as chemotherapy and surgery, affect a large number of cells, even those not infected with cancer.""
Douglas Rosenthal was born in Cleveland, Ohio. At the age of seven, he moved with his family to Washington, where he finished elementary and high school. In high school, Rosenthal became interested in biology and chemistry, both at the MRC Research Station and working with his biology professor at Case High School.
Rosenthal completed his basic and master studies at the Faculty of Biology in Cleveland, where he studied molecular biology and experimental biomedicine. At the invitation of renowned professor Robert Weinberg (who discovered human oncogenes, that is the genes that cause malignancies), he went to the MIT - Massachusetts Institute of Technology in his laboratory to study the causes of breast cancer metastasis.
The scientist Douglas Rosenthal has done a number of researches in the field of biology. Currently, he is affiliated with the Cleveland Center for Membrane and Structural Biology (CCMSB). He serves as a member of this center since 2015.
From 1991 to 1994, as a Postdoctoral Fellow, Rosenthal did postdoctoral research at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge.
Previously, he has worked at the Cleveland Institute for Computational Biology as a biology professor and researcher. He held this position from 2005 to 2015. 
Over the period from 1995 to 2005, Rosenthal has done a number of researches in the field of biology, affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic - Lerner Research Institute.
For his research studies, Rosenthal utilizes molecular structures from electron microscopy (EM), x-ray crystallography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Furthermore, Douglas Rosenthal has authored the books: Atomic Evidence and The Body’s Motors.
Rosenthal holds a Bachelor’s, Masters’s and Ph.D. in Biology from the Case Western Reserve University.",,,,,Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland,Ohio,US,NA,NA,Structural Biotechnology,Structural Biotechnologist,NA,1,public,2019-09-13,2014,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Subsequently I received a Master's degree in Developmental Biology from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1995. I then came to the US and studied the structures of death domains from the Drosophila proteins Pelle and Tube implicated in fly development and innate immunity, for which I received my Ph.D. in molecular biophysics under the guidance of Dr. Stephen Sprang at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas in 2000. I continued my postdoctoral training with Dr. Timothy Springer at the Center for Blood Research, Harvard Medical School focusing on cell adhesion receptors such as integrins and ICAMs, both of which play important roles in immune surveillance, thrombosis, and tumor metastasis. I established my research group at NIH in 2006 investigating the structures of innate immune receptors, inflammasomes, and adapter molecules implicated in antimicrobial host defense and inflammatory disorders. In 2014 I joined the faculty at the Case Western Reserve University's Department of Pathoogy. The current focus of the Xiao lab is the molecular mechanism of pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death; and modulation of inflammatory caspases using chemical biology approaches to target inflammatory disorders.",,,,,Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland,OH,US,2546,RINGGOLD,Department of Pathology,Associate Professor,NA,1,public,2014-12-02,2014,09,NA,NA,NA,NA

Charles,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,King,Charles H. King,,0000-0001-8349-9270,"Dr. Charles King is a medical specialist in the area of infectious diseases, and a long-time researcher in the study of communicable diseases of sub-Saharan Africa. Although his academic base is the Center for Global Health and Diseases at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, for 30 years, he has studied the many factors related to parasitic infections and mosquito-borne diseases on the Kenyan south coast (Kwale County), in the Northeastern Province area (Ijara County) and along Lake Victoria (Usenge community). He has worked extensively with the Ministry of Health and now with Kenya Medical Research Institute on the problems of preventing and controlling these kinds of diseases in the communities where they most frequently occur.

He also serves as Senior Scientist for the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operational Research and Evaluation (SCORE) based at the University of Georgia in Athens, Ga.

Research projects have involved clinical trials for optimal control of the morbidity of parasitic disease, eco-epidemiological surveys of the space-time distribution of infection, family studies of the heretability of disease due to schistosomiasis (bilharzia), evaluation of ultrasound and dipstick diagnosis of urogenital schistosomiasis, and dynamic computer modeling of infection pathways for better implementation of disease control options. Earlier studies focused on the pathways of early human immune response to multicellular parasites (helminths).

Current projects are focused on the impact of maternal parasite infections on the immune responses of newborn children. Separate community-based studies are examining individual and household risk factors for the mosquito-borne viral infections chikungunya, dengue fever, and Rift Valley fever.

Dr. King has served on advisory panels for the World Health Organization, the Wellcome Trust, and the National Institutes of Health.

Roger,2016-04-15,2016-04-15,French,Roger H. French,,0000-0002-6162-0532,"Roger H. French is the Kyocera Professor in the Case School of Engineering, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio. His primary appointment is in Materials Science and Engineering, and he has secondary appointments in Macromolecular Science, Computer and Data Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, and Physics. He is the faculty director of the CWRU Applied Data Science program which offers graduate classes and an undergraduate minor university-wide. He is the director of the SDLE Research Center at CWRU, an Ohio Third Frontier, Wright Project center focused on lifetime and degradation science of long lived technologies and data science and analytics. 
     He is a participant in the Performance and Reliability of Photovoltaic Systems task 13 of the International Energy Agency, Photovoltaic Power Systems Programme. He is a member of IEC TC82-WG2,WG3 “Solar Photovoltaic Energy Systems, Modules & Systems” US-Technical Advisory Group; the Standards Technical Panel (STP) of UL, “Flat-Plate Photovoltaic Modules and Panels”; Intl. PV Module QA Task Force; and ASTM Committees on Weathering and Durability: Service Life Prediction and Photovoltaic Electric Power Conversion. He was a member of the U. S. Department of Energy, Basic Energy Science Advisory Committee. 
     His group of more than 30 students and associates uses VUV and optical spectroscopies, spectroscopic ellipsometry to study optical properties, electronic structure, and radiation durability of optical materials, polymers, ceramics, and liquids. Optical properties determine the van der Waals quantum electrodynamical interactions which drive wetting and mesoscale assembly in systems such as nanotubes and biomolecular materials such as DNA, and proteins. 
     His group develops Hadoop2/Hbase/Spark-based, non-relational, distributed computing environments for data science and analytics of complex systems. This allows multi-factor real world performance to be integrated with lab-based experimental datasets to, for example, identify degradation mechanisms and pathways active over a technology’s lifetime. These approaches use network modeling, using structural equations, and graphs to model global spatio-temporal systems such as PV power plants and buildings. 
Lifetime and degradation science (L&DS) looks at long-lived environmentally-exposed materials, components, and systems such as PV technologies and roofing, building exteriors, and more. For example DOE-SunShot projects focus on crystalline silicon PERC modules lifetime performance. The SDLE Research center uses data science and machine learning methods for a broad range of energy and materials projects, including a DOE ARPA-E funded building energy efficiency project and a DOE NETL funded Rapid Alloy Qualification project. 
     Prior to joining Case Western Reserve in 2010, French was a Research Fellow in Central Research and Development, DuPont Co. (starting in 1985) and Adjunct Professor of Materials Science, University of Pennsylvania (from 1994). He received his B. S. from Cornell University and his Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, both in Materials Science. 
     He has published 158 journal articles, 135 proceedings papers, 1 book, 18 book chapters, 6 software packages, 6 open datasets, and given 159 invited talks and 297 conference presentations. He has 28 issued U. S. patents and 1 active filing.",,,,,Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland,OH,US,2546,RINGGOLD,Materials Science and Engineering,Kyocera Professor,http://engineering.case.edu/profiles/rxf131,1,public,2018-06-06,2010,08,15,NA,NA,NA

After receiving her Ph.D. in 2019, she became a U.S. Fulbright Postdoctoral Scholar (2019-2021) hosted in the Classical and Ancient Near Eastern Archaeology Department at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. 

Dr. Laughlin has a broad scope of experience, including but not limited to polytheistic religions, historical archaeology, surveys, and excavations in Australia, Egypt, Greece, Haiti, Italy (Naples, Pompeii, Rome, Sicily, and Tivoli), South Korea, Southern Levant (Ancient Judea, Palestine, Jordan), and Turkey. 

Her archaeological training spans from Middle Bronze Age through the Roman Imperial Period. However, her specific research and interests are within the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Her current research explores ancient polytheistic religions; and the ruler's political ploys, which appropriated and, in some instances, created erasure of ancient Egyptian deities east and west of the Mediterranean. The scope of her research showcases material culture used as forms of media that became dynamic tools within the political propaganda of ancient rulers. Her research ultimately exhibits various aspects of how ancient religion helped shape ancient cultures and societies.

Dr. Laughlin has a B.A. in Business Management and Psychology from DePaul University (Chicago, Illinois), an M.A. in Intercultural Religious and Cross-Cultural Studies with a minor in Biblical Studies from Catholic Theological Union (Chicago, Illinois), and a Ph.D. in Ancient Near Eastern Archaeology and Anthropology with a minor in Early Church History from Andrews University (Berrien Springs, Michigan).",,,,,Case Western Reserve University,Cleveland,OH,US,2546,RINGGOLD,Classics,Andrew W.
